##Credits
Special thanks to the following individuals for their contributions:
-Jeffery Chieh-Liu (TA team): for helping me with conditional formatting 
-LiMei Hou (BCS tutor): for advicing me that I shouldn't have too many for-loops within a script because it would just slow down the execution process
-All other AskBCS helpers: for providing me useful functions, such as the functions to convert numbers in scientific notation to normal numbers and converting decimals to percentages

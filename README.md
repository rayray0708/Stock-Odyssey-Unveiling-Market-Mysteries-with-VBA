# VBA-challenge
## Description 
In this project, I'm analysing generated stock market data to uncover hidden trends and gain more insight into the dataset. Specifically, I'll create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol
- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.

Furthermore, I will also add functionality to my script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

## Usage
To see the VBA script, please navigate to "Hand in" folder and select "VBA script (challenge2)". It's recommended that you open this file via Excel VBA. 

## Credits
Special thanks to the following individuals for their contributions:
-Jeffery Chieh-Liu (TA team): for helping me with conditional formatting 
-LiMei Hou (BCS tutor): for advicing me that I shouldn't have too many for-loops within a script because it would just slow down the execution process
-All other AskBCS helpers: for providing me with useful functions, such as the functions to convert numbers in scientific notation to normal numbers and converting decimals to percentages
